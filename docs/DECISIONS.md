## ADR-0001: pnpm workspaces with a flat `packages/*` + `apps/*` layout

**Context:** the stack is fixed to pnpm workspaces (`docs/BACKLOG.md`), with five
independently publishable units: `core`, `worker`, `api`, `cli`, `ui`, plus a
non-package `examples` directory added on day 29.

**Decision:** one `pnpm-workspace.yaml` globbing `packages/*`, `apps/*` and
`examples/*`. `apps/ui` sits outside `packages/*` because it is a deployable
application, not a library other packages depend on. Packages are scoped
`@dee/*` and depend on each other via `workspace:*`.

**Consequence:** `packages/core` has no dependency on any other workspace
package, keeping it usable standalone. `worker`, `api` and `cli` depend on
`core`. Adding a new package later is a new directory plus one workspace
glob match, no config change.

## ADR-0002: one shared strict `tsconfig.base.json`, per-package `typecheck`

**Context:** the quality bar (`docs/BACKLOG.md`, A6) forbids `any` and
requires strict typing across every package.

**Decision:** a single `tsconfig.base.json` at the repository root carries
`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and
related flags. Each package's `tsconfig.json` only extends it and sets
`rootDir`/`outDir`. The root `typecheck` script runs `pnpm -r run
typecheck`, so a package cannot silently opt out of strictness.

**Consequence:** a new package's baseline is strict by default. Loosening a
flag means editing one file, visible in review, rather than drifting per
package.

## ADR-0003: eslint flat config with `strictTypeChecked`, `any` as an error

**Context:** A6 forbids `any` outright and requires `unknown` with
narrowing instead.

**Decision:** `eslint.config.js` uses `typescript-eslint`'s
`strictTypeChecked` and `stylisticTypeChecked` presets with
`projectService: true`, and turns `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` into
an error rather than relying on convention. `eslint-config-prettier` is
applied last so formatting is prettier's job alone, never eslint's.

**Consequence:** `any` fails `pnpm run lint`, not just code review. Style
disagreements between eslint and prettier cannot happen because eslint's
stylistic rules that conflict with prettier are disabled.

## ADR-0004: postgres 16 only through docker compose, no embedded database

**Context:** the stack is fixed to PostgreSQL 16. Integration tests need a
real database (`docs/BACKLOG.md`, A6: "integration tests run against a real
postgres").

**Decision:** `docker-compose.yml` runs a single `postgres:16` service with
a healthcheck, configured from `.env.example`. CI starts the same image as
a GitHub Actions service container rather than a separate managed
database, so local and CI environments match.

**Consequence:** `pnpm run verify` alone (without `docker compose up -d`)
does not exercise anything that touches postgres yet, since no
database-backed code exists before day 2. From day 2 onward, integration
tests require the compose service (or an equivalent) to be running.
